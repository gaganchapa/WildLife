# RailGuard
The escalating incidences of train-wildlife collisions, especially with elephants, are a real blow
to forest-based wildlife conservation efforts. This not only endangers the animals (elephants)
but also shows significant damage to trains and railway infrastructure; hence, there is an urgent
need for effective mitigation measures and sustainable solutions for wildlife conservation. This
study recommends using Rail Guard, an innovative way of tackling this problem. To
quickly identify wild animals, such as elephants, in real-time and alert train operators, this
work relies on advanced deep learning algorithms and camera systems set at specific points
on railway tracks. Train operators can immediately slow down the trains upon receiving alerts,
ensuring that passengers and wildlife are safe. Rail Guard has the potential to enhance
wildlife conservation initiatives through data analysis, which will provide useful insights into
animal behaviour and movement patterns. Using data analytics tools provides an option to reduce
adverse impacts caused by railway expansion on various animal species, thus raising optimism
about balancing progress and preservation to reach a sustainable existence between railways and
forests.
