# RailGuard
The escalating incidences of train-wildlife collisions, especially with elephants, are a real blow
to forest-based wildlife conservation efforts. This not only endangers the animals (elephants)
but also shows significant damage to trains and railway infrastructure; hence, there is an urgent
need for effective mitigation measures and sustainable solutions for wildlife conservation. This
study recommends using Rail Guard, an innovative way of tackling this problem. To
quickly identify wild animals, such as elephants, in real-time and alert train operators, this
work relies on advanced deep learning algorithms and camera systems set at specific points
on railway tracks. Train operators can immediately slow down the trains upon receiving alerts,
ensuring that passengers and wildlife are safe. Rail Guard has the potential to enhance
wildlife conservation initiatives through data analysis, which will provide useful insights into
animal behaviour and movement patterns. Using data analytics tools provides an option to reduce
adverse impacts caused by railway expansion on various animal species, thus raising optimism
about balancing progress and preservation to reach a sustainable existence between railways and
forests.

The Real-Time Elephant Detection web app utilizes the advanced YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once, version 8) algorithm to accurately identify elephants on railway tracks. This state-of-the-art deep learning model processes live camera feeds to detect elephants in real-time, providing instant alerts to train locopilots. Upon detection, the app triggers a buzzer notification to promptly warn the train driver of potential hazards on the tracks. This proactive alert system significantly enhances safety by allowing the train crew to take necessary precautions and prevent collisions, thereby safeguarding both wildlife and passengers. YOLOv8's high accuracy and speed make it an ideal choice for this critical application, ensuring timely and reliable elephant detection.
